Introduction
------------

Go Mobile uses standard Plone skin mechanism. You can use whatever theming technique
you wish, as long as it can be used as a Plone skin.

The only difference between a normal Plone theme and 
Go Mobile theme is that Go Mobile theme name is read
from the property::

   portal_properties.mobile_properties.mobile_skin
   
Instead of standard::

   portal_skins.default_skin

Best practices
--------------

* Use namespace "gomobiletheme" for Go Mobile themes

* Read :doc:`Transformations </developer-manual/transformations>` for info about different CSS files
  and their purposes.

Creating your first theme
-------------------------

You can include ``paster`` command in your ``buildout.cfg``
with ``gomobile.templates`` package included.
This will you give a ``paster`` command with the 
template *gomobile_theme*.

buildout.cfg::

        parts =
                ...
                paster

        [paster]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = 
                PasteScript 
                gomobile.templates
                ${instance:eggs}

Then you can create your own theme skeleton with::

        bin/buildout # reruns to build paster command
        cd src
        ../bin/paster create -t gomobile_theme gomobiletheme.yourcompanyname
        # Answer questions
        # Source code is generated for a mobile theme add-on skeleton
        
Then follow generic `paster instructions for Plone <http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.developermanual/trunk/source/tutorials/paste.txt>`_ how to include 
the generated source code egg in ``buildout.cfg``.

gomobiletheme.basic
-------------------

A basic Plone 4 Sunburst like theme is supplied with Go Mobile for Plone (gomobiletheme.basic package).
It is recommended that you recycle theme viewlets from this package.

See plonecommunity.app example how to do this.

Below are some notes for theming,  used by gomobiletheme.basic 
You may or may not opt-in to use these practices.

* `gomobiletheme.basic README <http://plonegomobile.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gomobile/gomobiletheme.basic/README.txt>`_ 

Notes
=====

* Top actions viewlet (search icon, contact icon) is not supported on Plone 3

Customization examples
-----------------------

One maintained public example exists

* plonecommunity.mobi `site <http://plonecommunity.mobi>`_ and the `source code <http://plonegomobile.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gomobile/plonecommunity.app>`_

Plone 3 compatibility
======================

``gomobiletheme.basic`` has some special arrangemenets
to maintain backwards compatibility with Plone 3.
Please see ``gomobiltheme.basic`` ``README.txt``
file for more information.

five.grok used
==============

gomobiletheme.basic uses five.grok for viewlets and static media - this differs
from old Plone 3 practice.

Inheriting templates
++++++++++++++++++++

You can recycle and modify viewlets given in gomobiletheme.basic package in your custom theme.

Make sure five.grok is initializer properly in your product (five.grok directive in configure.zcml).

Create a viewlets.py code with the followind content::

        
        from zope.interface import Interface
        from five import grok
        
        from collective.fastview.utilities import fix_grok_template_inheritance
        from gomobiletheme.basic import viewlets as base
        from gomobiletheme.basic.viewlets import MainViewletManager
        from plonecommunity.app.interfaces import IThemeLayer
        
        # Viewlets are on all content by default.
        grok.context(Interface)
        
        # Use templates directory to search for templates.
        grok.templatedir("templates")
        
        # Viewlets are active only when the theme layer is activated
        # 1) You must run add-on installer for your add-on product quick installer
        # 2) You must access the site through mobile URL
        grok.layer(IThemeLayer)
        
        # Use this viewlet manager for mobile viewlets
        grok.viewletmanager(MainViewletManager)

Since there is a problem with Grok 1.0 template inheritance (only Grok 1.0 works with Plone),
you need to specially define if you want to use parent class templates instead of overriding
templates in your viewlets.py code::

        class Logo(base.Logo):    
            """ Mobile site logo """
            
            def getLogoName(self):
                return "++resource++plonecommunity.app/plone-logo-white-on-blue.png"
        
        # Fix for grok 1.0 template inheritance
        # https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/255005
        fix_grok_template_inheritance(Logo, base.Logo)

Static media
============

Static media is provided by five.grok *static* folder mechanism.

References to static media are set in Head viewlet.
You can override this viewlet and make static media to point to your own 
set of files. In this case, you need to copy the whole *static* folder
from gomobiletheme.basic to your own theme product.

Example::

        class Head(base.Head):
            """
            Override <head> generation so that we use CSS files 
            and static resources specific to this skin.
            """
            
            def resource_url(self):
                """ Get static resource URL.
                
                See gomobiletheme.basic.viewlets.Head for more information.
                """
                
                # You need to copy whole gomobiletheme.basic/gomobiletheme/basic/statuc
                # folder to your own product and refer it here to use its CSS
                
                # return self.portal_url + "/" + "++resource++plonecommunity.app"
                
If you a running a very simple site and you do not wish to override any resources
inherited from base theme package, you can use AdditionalHead viewlet
to mix in <head> resources without overriding existing ones.

No viewlet managers
===================
  
collective.fastview add-on is used to render viewlets directly and there are no viewlet managers in mobile theme.
All mobile viewlets are registered against viewlet manager gomobiletheme.basic.viewlets.MainViewletManager.

Theme layer is mobile aware
===========================

All mobile views and viewlets are registered against your theme layer, which is a sublass
of mobile layer - this way mobile views do not conflict with web views and cannot
be accidentally exposed to web.

See plonecommunity.app.interfaces for the example.

Avoid old style skins folder
============================

For basic themes you generally don't need to customize main_template or old skin layers files,
so you do not need to have *skins* structure in your own theme
  
* <img> images should be run through :doc:`mobile image resize </developer-manual/transformations>`

* All template code which contains WYSIWYG editable HTML should run through 
  :doc:`HTML processor </developer-manual/transformations>` to make it mobile compatible.

Mobile theme specials

Full examples
=============

See

* `plonecommunity.app <http://code.google.com/p/plonegomobile/source/browse/trunk/gomobile/#gomobile/plonecommunity.app/plonecommunity/app>`_
  for basic customizations (how to change logo, CSS files) and declare your own skin

Creating a theme skeleton
=========================

TODO: Full tutorial will be done.

Use Paster command to create a Plone 3 application.

Copy necessary changes by looking example in plonecommunity.app

* setup.py

* configure.zcml

* interfaces.py

* viewlets.py

* profiles/default/skins.xml

* profiles/defaukt/propertiestool.xml

* Copy static media folder from gomobiletheme.basic as is.

* Override head viewlet in viewlets.py

* Override logo viewlet in viewlets.py

* If you need to change main_template.pt, you need to also copy and modify from gomobiletheme.basic

        * skins/gomobiletheme_basic/main_template.pt to skins/yourtheme/main_template.pt
        
        * profiles/default/skins.xml

        * Add skins registration to configure.zcml

Declaring your theme
====================

The following steps are needed to make Plone site aware of your theme,
it is installable through add-on instalelr
and it correctly extends the existing Go Mobile Default Theme.

* Create propertiestool.xml which will set your theme as active mobile theme::

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<object name="portal_properties" meta_type="Plone Properties Tool">
	 <object name="mobile_properties" meta_type="Plone Property Sheet" title="Mobile site specific settings">
	  <property name="mobile_skin" type="string" purge="False">mFabrik Mobile Theme</property>	
	 </object>
	</object>
	
* Declare dependency to Go Mobile Default Theme skin layer in skins.xml::

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<object name="portal_skins" allow_any="False" cookie_persistence="False">
	
	 <skin-path name="mFabrik Mobile Theme" based-on="Go Mobile Default Theme">
	 </skin-path>
	
	</object>

* Declare your add-on installer profile

::

  <genericsetup:registerProfile
      name="default"
      title="mFabrik Mobile Theme"
      directory="profiles/default"
      description='mFabrik theme for mobile sites'
      provides="Products.GenericSetup.interfaces.EXTENSION"
      />

* Declare your theme interface which subclasses Go Mobile Default Theme::

	import gomobiletheme.basic.interfaces as base
	
	class IThemeLayer(base.IThemeLayer):
	    """ mFabrik mobile theme layer.
	
	    """

* Declare your theme layer for Zope

::
 
  <interface
    interface=".interfaces.IThemeLayer"
    type="zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserSkinType"
    name="mFabrik Mobile Theme"
    />

Note that two latter steps differ if five.grok *grok.skin()* directive is used.

Declaring dependency to gomobiletheme.basic
============================================

To use its main_template.pt add profiles/default/skins.xml to your theme package::

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        
        <object name="portal_skins" allow_any="False" cookie_persistence="False">
        
                 <!-- Declare dependency to gomobiletheme.basic so that its skin layeres are also included when this theme is installed -->
                 <skin-path name="plonecommunity.mobi theme" based-on="Go Mobile Default Theme">
                 </skin-path>
                
        
        </object>
        
Overriding the logo
===================

Add to your viewlets.py::
        
        from collective.fastview.utilities import fix_grok_template_inheritance
        from gomobiletheme.basic import viewlets as base
        
        # ..All other grok theme setup code here...

        class Logo(base.Logo):    
            """ Mobile site logo """
            
            def getLogoName(self):
                return "++resource++plonecommunity.app/plone-logo-white-on-blue.png"
        
        # Fix for grok 1.0 template inheritance
        # https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/255005
        fix_grok_template_inheritance(Logo, base.Logo)
