Introduction
-------------

This page gives overview of Go Mobile for Plone architecture.

Go Mobile for Plone is divided to several Python packages, packed as Python eggs.
Egg files are distributed through Python egg index services, like Python Package Index (PyPi).
By dividing the product to small components we achieve

* Better code reuse. mobile.* packages do not have Zope dependencies and 
  can be used with any Pytohn CMS.

* Release early, release often: Bug fix releases can be rolled out for individual packages.

Some of the functionality is built on existing Python libraries (vObject, lxml, Python Imaging Library).

   Architectural overview
   
Python run-time
-----------------

Plone 3 CMS is built on the top of Python runtime.
Python is a remarkably powerful dynamic programming language that is used in a wide variety of application domains.
Specifically, Python version 2.4 is used (will be changed in Plone 4).

Generic mobile.* libraries for Python
--------------------------------------

mobile.* namespace packages can be used with any Python project.
For example, mFabrik team has succesfully used the same codebase
for Django CMS and Ploen sites.

mobile.sniffer
==============

   Handset detection backends.

* Abstraction layout for different handset database abstraction

* Brand name recognizition regular expressions for mobile redirects two provide :doc:`two pass user agent detection </usermanual/sniffing>`

* Pluggable backend mechanism

* Currently supports following handset databases: Wurfl, DeviceAtlas, Apex Vertex, WAP profiles. 

mobile.heurestic
================

Condensed years of experience dealing with mobile phone complexity.
This package contains rules-of-thumb how to generate HTML compatible for different user agents.

* Serving correct content type and docstring

* Phone number links

* Openining a GPS navigator / maps application

* Downloadable vCards

Internally uses `vobject <http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/>`_ Python module.

mobile.htmlprocessing
======================

mobile.htmlprocessing provides utilities to sanitize arbitary HTML for mobile output.

* Transform HTML to XHTML

* Rewrite <img> tags

* Clean up untrusted HTML code

Internally uses `lxml <http://codespeak.net/lxml/>`_ Python module.

Plone specific packages
------------------------

gomobile.* provides Plone specific packages. The packages are split so that
you need to install only packages and modules relevant to your site use case
e.g. no multichannel publishing if mobile-only site is being built.

gomobiletheme.* namespace is reserved for mobile site theme products.

gomobile.mobile
=============== 

This package provides Plone core mobile functionality.

* Mobile behavior: mobile specific settings for Archetypes content 

* Mobile add-on layer and theme layer

* URL mapper between web and mobile site

* Mobile site redirector
	
* Preview action and mobile simulator CSS and JS code
	
* Tracking and analytics

* Content type and docstring abstraction
	
* Plone specific HTML processing and mobile image resizer

* Mobile folder listing

* Documentation in Sphinx format

gomobile.convergence
=====================

Multichannel publishing options.

* Multi-channel publishing behavior for Archetypes content

* Set folder/page to be available in web and mobile only
	
* Override field values individually e.g. different body text for a page on web and mobile (gomobile.convergence.overrider)

* Special navigation code supporting multi-channel publishing

gomobiletheme.basic
====================

Default mobile site theme which can be extended for your specific needs.

See more about :doc:`theming </developermanual/theming>`.

* Uses `Grok <http://grok.zope.org>`_ API and five.grok views and viewlets

* `Zope Page Templates <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/AppendixC.html>`_ (.pt) are used as the template language  

gomobile.imageinfo
==================

Helpers to open and read various kind of persistent image objects used
in Zope environments.

gomobile.supporter
====================

Add mobile support for various Plone add-on products which are not part of Plone core.

gomobile.buildout
===================

`Buildout <http://www.buildout.org>`_ recipes for repeatable installations. 

* Include Go Mobile with your Plone set-up

* Checking out the source code  

* Making releases.

mfabrik.behaviorutilities
===========================

Use `plone.behavior <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.behavior>` content extension mechanism with 
`Archetypes http://plone.org/products/archetypes<>` content type subsystem.

collective.fastview
=====================

Helper methods for Plone and Grok views and viewlets.
