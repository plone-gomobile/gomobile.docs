 Extending Go Mobile framework
================================

Basically everything can be overridden in Go Mobile per site or per application server
basis using Zope browser layers or utility adapters. This
makes it possible to adapt the framework for your custom needs easier, 
without too much fighting.

First be familiar how Zope adapter mechanism works.

Core interfaces
---------------

Core interfaces for adapters and utilities are defined in *gomobile.mobile.interfaces*
Python package. They come with extensive commenting.

Look for implementation source code 

* How to change a specific feature using subclassing

* How to change a specific feature by making your own implementation of the interface
