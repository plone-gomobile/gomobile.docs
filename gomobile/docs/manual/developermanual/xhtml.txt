Introduction
------------

Mobile browsers make a fuss about XHTML.
In reality, mobile phones they support X-less HTML better,
no matter what you are being told.

XHTML compatiblity is still needed for the search bots,
if you wish to make your pages appear in the mobile search results.
If you cannot provide XHTML compatible output, do not expect
your pages appear in mobile search engines.

See ::doc::`Sniffing chapter </usermanual/sniffing>` for more information.
