============================
 Previewing the mobile site
============================

Introduction
------------

Go Mobile gives you a single click preview to see how your site will look on
a mobile screen-

The site is fully navigable in the preview mode 

* You can move from the page to another

* You can fill in forms and do HTTP posts

Background on preview technology
---------------------------------

Mobile preview is implemented using HTML IFRAME and AJAX technologies.
It might not give you 100% accurate preview. However, you can expect
to iron out 90% of content related mobile issues with the preview  functionality.

Preview and login
-----------------

Preview pages are delivered using special *preview* hostname like *preview.yoursite.com*.

The difference between previewed pages and mobile pages from actual *m.yoursite.com* domain
is that preview pages contain a cross-site Javascript snippet to bootstrap the simulator
IFRAME.

Since IFRAME loads from subdomain, your authentication mechanism must 
support subdomains. gomobile.mobile product modifies Plone login mechanism so that your 
cookie is effective for \*.yoursite.com hostnames.

.. note ::

	If you login using Zope HTTP Auth login and use preview you cannot
	preview unpublished pages. Instead, a login prompt is displayed
	in the simulator.
