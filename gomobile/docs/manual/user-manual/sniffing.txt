 Mobile browser detection
===========================

Go Mobile aims to strive to support every HTML capable phone on this planet, 
not just iPhone and other popular smartphones. 
Go Mobile users mobile.sniffer Python package to provide abstraction layer for handset detection
over different handset databases.

* Choose your favorite handset database: DeviceAtlas, Wurfl or internal library.

* mobile.sniffer abstraction layer can source information from multiple databases,
  reaching potential of over 10000 known handset records.

* See :doc:`what sites features are varied by the handset </user_manual/varying>` 

* Free `Wurfl database <http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/>`_ is shipped with the product so that handset detection
  works out-of-the-box

For more information, see mobile.sniffer Python package.

Enabling handset detection
---------------------------

Handset detection is enabled out of the box and you don't need to do anything special to use it.
Wurlf database is supplied with the product.

See mobile.sniffer.wurlf package source code for details.

Two-phase handset detection
---------------------------

Handset detection and varying is done in two phases.

* Brand name recognizition algorithm is used to redirect web site visitors to mobile site.
  We do not directly rely on handset database here, as user agent string analysis
  would provide too many false positives otherwise.
  This is defined in mobile.sniffer.detect and gomobile.mobile.redirector packages.
  
* When the site is rendered in mobile mode, handset properties are read using
  mobile.sniffer package. Currently this is mainly utilized for screen width and height.
  
* Special heurestics rules can be applied by mobile.heurestics package and they
  might or might not be tied to handset database. 
  Rules include
  
  * How to make phone numbers clickable
  
  * Creating downloadedable vcards / phone numbers
  
  * Opening the phone map / navigator
  
HTML and XHTML
--------------

Mobile site crawler robots (googlebot-mobile) are served
content as XHTML instead HTML, since these user agents demand so.
For all other handsets HTML is served as HTML 4.0 transitional, 
since the experience has proven this to be the most working solution.

This is detected separately from the handset detection using
mobile.heurestics.contenttype package.

Testing different handsets
--------------------------

Use `Firefox User Agent Switcher extension <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59>`
to see how your site (image dimensions) look for different user agents.

Useful user agents::

        Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 3_0 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/528.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile/7A341 Safari/528.16

Changing handset database backend
---------------------------------

This is a developer level task.

The used handset database is configured on Plone site layer level.
To change it, you need to redefine IMobileUserAgentSniffer 
adapter for your site.

Updating Wurlf
--------------

New Wurlf database is shipped with every Go Mobile release.
If you manually want to update Wurlf, see mobile.sniffer package for
necessary files and scripts.
