 Navigation on mobile site 
===========================

Introduction
-------------

Since mobile screen estate is expensive, mobile navigation needs some
special consideration to work optimally.

Here are explained some options and rules which make navigation smooth on Go Mobile.

Mobile Site Actions
--------------------

The mobile site can have site actions in the right side of the header, that will be some
actions that are used often and they are represented with an icon.

For site actions to show up, they need to be specified in ZMI:

* Navigate to portal_actions

* Click "Add CMF Action Category"

* Enter "mobile_site_actions" into the ID field and click Add

* Select the newly created category and add CMF Action to it

* It is not enough only to specify the ID, but other fields also need some values, so
  select the newly created action

* Title, URL and Icon fields are required. For adding a search button, we'll use::

        Title: "Search",
        URL: "string:${portal_url}/search",
        Icon: "string:${portal_url}/++resource++gomobiletheme.basic/actions/search.png"

You can customize this viewlet by overriding *TopActions* viewlet in gomobiletheme.basic.


Mobile folder listing
----------------------

There is no space navigation portlet, or left side vertical navigation, on the mobile.
This is the main navigation method basically on every known web site. 

To allow easy navigation and automatic child content listing, 
each folderish content item has MobileFolderListing viewlet, 
defined in gomobiletheme.basic package. It displays "Here you can also find:" label
and the summary of child content at the bottom of the page.

However, this method is impractical for folders containing more than ten to twenty items.
You can opt-out pages from automatic folder listing using 
*Mobile options* form.

* Folderish content item generates mobile folder listing

* Any item appears in mobile folder listing

.. note ::

        If document actions viewlet is hidden, you need to first
        make it visible using Plone's @@manage-viewlets
        functionality to access the page.


Main navigation
----------------

The navigation is based on the mobile_navigation action category, and it can be set
only through ZMI:

* Navigate to portal_actions

* Click "Add CMF Action Category"

* Enter "mobile_navigation" into the ID field and click Add

* Select the newly created category and add CMF Action to it

* It is not enough only to specify the ID, but other fields also need some values, so
  select the newly created action

* Title and URL fields are required (the URL field is an expression so you can use
  for example "string:${portal_url}/" here for the home page)

You can customize this viewlet by overriding *Navigation* viewlet in gomobiletheme.basic.


Sections
---------

Sections are the text links found in the footer, i,e. Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Full Site

This can be set the same way as the main navigation, only the name of the category 
differs, as the sections use "mobile_sections".

You can customize this viewlet by overriding *Sections* viewlet in gomobiletheme.basic.


Front page shortcut
-------------------

Site logo acts as front page shortcut, like it does on web pages.
