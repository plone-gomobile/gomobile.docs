 Tracking mobile visitors
============================

Mobile browser limitations prevent
using Javascript based tracking on mobile pages,
which is the most dominant tracking form on the web.

Also, the collected tracking data for mobile differs.
The site owner is more interest what kind of browsers
and handsets visit on the site.

Go Mobile supports pluggable tracking backends.
You can choose one of tracking backends supported
out of the box, or write your own.

Supported tracking services
----------------------------

* Google Analytics Mobile

* AdMob

* Bango

How to set-up a tracker (Google)
----------------------------------

* Visit Google Analytics site and create a new site

* When Google Analytics offers you a tracking code, choose Advanced -> Mobile

* Extract tracking id which is in format "MO-1234-12"

* Now, go to :doc:`Go Mobile Settings`

* As a *tracker_name*, enter *google*

* As a *tracking_id*, enter the tracking id given by Google

.. note ::

	Google Analytics may complain that the tracker verification failed.
	This is normal.
	
	
Real IP address of the client
==============================

If you are using Apache's mod_proxy or similar virtual hosting solution, 
make sure that the real IP address of the client reaches the tracking code.

You need to make sure that your front-end server passes the IP information 
forward. For Apache, this setting is::

        ProxyVia on

Google Analytics mobile background
===================================

Tracking is done using 1x1 pixel GIF image called
*__utm.gif*. 
The image is a white pixel appearing in the footer. 
CSS style is used to fade away the image to invisible by setting 
opacity to 1%. However, this only works on browsers support *opacity*
CSS rule.

When the image URL is formed, HTTP request headers are read
and forwarded to Google Analytics as HTTP GET query parameters.
This way refering page etc. are propeply tracked.
