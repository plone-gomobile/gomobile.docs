Contribution agreement
----------------------

Currently all code must be GPL'ed as this is Plone Foundation's 
policy for Plone plug-ins. However this might change in the future. 

* We'd like to keep the copyright on a single party so we
  can make the necessary licensing adjustments in the future

* We'd like to use mFabrik branding for the project to show there is 
  at least one strong company behind the project - this is 
  prerequisitement for some customer 

* Since mFabrik has done the initial investment, we'd like to protect 
  and nourish the project until it is self-sustanaible and can be given 
  to a foundation or any other business interest neutral entity 

* There is also a possibility that we will raise funding for the 
  project and in this case IPR must be clear
