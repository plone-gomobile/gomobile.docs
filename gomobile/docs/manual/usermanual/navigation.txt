Introduction
-------------

Since mobile screen estate is expensive, mobile navigation needs some
special consideration to work optimally.

Here are explained some options and rules which make navigation smooth on Go Mobile.

Mobile folder listing
----------------------

There is no space navigation portlet, or left side vertical navigation, on the mobile.
This is the main navigation method basically on every known web site. 

To allow easy navigation and automatic child content listing, 
each folderish content item has MobileFolderListing viewlet, 
defined in gomobiletheme.basic package. It displays "Here you can also find:" label
and the summary of child content at the bottom of the page.

However, this method is impractical for folders containing more than ten to twenty items.
You can opt-out pages from automatic folder listing using 
*Mobile options* form.

* Folderish content item generates mobile folder listing

* Any item appears in mobile folder listing

.. note ::

        If document actions viewlet is hidden, you need to first
        make it visible using Plone's @@manage-viewlets
        functionality to access the page.

Sections
---------

Sections, i,e. top level tabs, are displayed at the bottom 
of the page.

These will contain

* All top level content items

* Tabs configured in ZMI portal_actions / portal_tabs

* Search link to the search form

* Feedback link to contact-info form

You can customize this by overriding *Sections* viewlet in gomobiletheme.basic.

Front page shortcut
-------------------

Site logo acts as front page shortcut, like it does on web pages.
