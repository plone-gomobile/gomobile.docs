 Optimal user experience
==========================

Go Mobile tries hard to achieve the most optimal mobile browsing experience,
and it success quite well. 

This all is achieved

* With many years of experience in mobile development

* ::doc::`Vary site features </usermanual/varying>` by `mobile browser detection </usernamual/sniffing>`
  to give user special goodies like clickable phone numbers and navigation links.

* Using ::doc::`mobile image optimization techniques </usermanual/resizing>`

* Both touch and keypad based navigation are supported. For example, padding is added to make links 
  easily touchable.

* Ensure fast page load times by making HTTP requests cacheable and carrier proxy friendly
