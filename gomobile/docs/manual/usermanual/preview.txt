 Mobile preview
======================

Go Mobile gives you a single click preview to see how your site will look on
a mobile screen-

The site is fully navigable in the preview mode 

* You can move from the page to another

* You can fill in forms and do HTTP posts

Background on preview technology
---------------------------------

Mobile preview is implemented using HTML IFRAME and AJAX technologies.
It might not give you 100% accurate preview. However, you can expect
to iron out 90% of content related mobile issues with the preview  functionality.

Preview and login
-----------------

Preview pages are delivered using special *preview* hostname like *preview.yoursite.com*.

The difference between previewed pages and mobile pages from actual *m.yoursite.com* domain
is that preview pages contain a cross-site Javascript snippet to bootstrap the simulator
IFRAME.

Since IFRAME loads from subdomain, your authentication mechanism must s
support subdomains. gomobile.mobile product modifies Plone login mechanism so that your 
cookie is effective for *.yoursite.com hostnames.

.. note ::

	If you login using Zope HTTP Auth login and use preview you cannot
	preview unpublished pages. Instead, a login prompt is displayed
	in the simulator.
