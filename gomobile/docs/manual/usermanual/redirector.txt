 Redirecting

Introduction
------------

Redirecting mobile users to mobile site is critical usability factor.
 
**No matter on which kind browser user types in the address, the user
should server the page in correct format.**

Isn't it utterly annoying when you read emails on a mobile, someone has
posted you a link, you click it and you are taken to slow, big, web page
 instead of mobile page? This does not happen with Go Mobile!

Unlike most solutions, 
Go Mobile redirector is able to match web and mobile content.
The user gets the correct content page always and is not sent to site root
when coming to the site on a mobile phone.
  
* The content, which the user is looking for, in not lost if the user is being redirected
  
* The user can opt-out from the mobile site and stay on the web site 
  with the mobile if the user wishes so

Redirecting logic

   Redirecting logic

* HTTP request arrives to the web site from the user browser

* Mobile browser is detected using *brand detection*

* HTTP Moved Temporary response is given and the user is taken to mobile site

* Mobile site as a link "Go to web site" which points to website.com/@@force_web

* If the user clicks this link a special cookie is not set,
  so that he/she is no longer automatically taken to mobile site from this browser
  
Web and mobile domain name mappings
-----------------------------------

By default, Go Mobile will prefixes your web site name with m. domain name prefix
and assumes this is your mobile site. This can be changed in ::doc::`settings </usermanual/settings>.
WWW prefix is removed from the domain before redirecting.

E.g. Visitor coming to *yoursite.com* with a mobile browser is redirected to *m.yoursite.com*,
still having the content path intact.

If you use Go Mobile Convergence add-on and the page does not exist in the mobile domain,
let's say a forum post comment page which is too complex for a mobile, the user is
redirected to the mobile site root. 

Manual redirecting URLs
-----------------------

Go Mobile exposes two views to all content objects which you can use to do manual redirects

* @@go_to_mobile_site

* @@go_to_web_site

These views map to URI namespaces and if use properly, they do not lose the desired
content, when redirecting.

You can add the URL expressions e.g. to site actions using the following TALES expression::

        string:${object_url}/@@go_to_mobile_site

Or simply adding a link by hand in WYSIWYG editor HTML mode::

        <a href="@@go_to_mobile_site">Go to mobile site</a>
        
Note that this method assumes that your content sets the page
base url in HTML <head>. All Plone content does this by default.
