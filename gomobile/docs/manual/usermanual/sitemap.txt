Introduction
-------------

Go Mobile suppports mobile sitemaps.
This is a sitemap protocol extension which tells the search engines

* which pages are avaiable on the site 

* which are mobile pages

.. note ::

        Sitemap must be enabled in Site setup before mobile sitemaps are available.

robots.txt
===========

If you are using a robots.txt which limits access to all HTTP GET queries by default,
you need to add the following exception::         

        Allow: /@@mobile_sitemap?         
        
Mobile sitemap URLs
--------------------

Mobile sitemap is mapped to @@mobile_sitemap view.

Example links which you can put in Google Webmaster tools.

Index one language of certain site::
    
    http://yoursite/@@mobile_sitemap?language=fi&mode=mobile
    
Index all languages of certain site::    
    
    http://yoursite/@@mobile_sitemap?language=ALL&mode=mobile
    
This does not generate <mobile:mobile /> tag and is not considered as mobile sitemap::
    
    http://yoursite/@@mobile_sitemap?language=ALL&mode=web
