Theming aims to have great visuals, without sacrifying speed and usability,
on every kind of mobile phone. 

Go Mobile themes support

* Optimizing images by the ::doc::`browser screen size </usermanual/sniffing>`

* Varying CSS for low end and smartphones

* Varying page templates and HTML snippets
  for low end and smartphones 

Go Mobile ships with one default, blueish, Plone theme
which is similar to one used at `plone.org <http://plone.org>`_.

It is often the case that you end up viewing the mobile site
on a desktop browser (development, testing).
When viewed on the desktop browser (800 pixels or wider),
the mobile theme content column is centered on the screen
and width clipped to 800 pixels, so that big screens
do not give a false image how the site should look.

HTML and XHTML outputs are supported.

Normal Plone best practices can be used to create new themes.
For more information how to create your own theme,
consult `Developer Manual theming section </developermanual/theming.txt>`_.
